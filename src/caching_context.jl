# we have to somehow decide before hand which things we want to recursively hash and which
# we don't. Many repeated recurisve hashes are expensive, especially for SHA-based hashing,
# this is why we use the BufferedHashState. But it should be okay to recursively hash from
# time to time; calls to `get!` are somewhere on the order of 20-50 times slower than a call
# to hash individual bytes, so as long as CACHE_OBJECT_THRESHOLD is well above this range of
# values, we should be fine (here it is 2^12 = 4096).

    CachedHash(context)

Setup a hash context that includes a cache of hash results. By default, it stores the result
of hashing types and large values. Calling the same cached hash context will re-use this
cache, possibly improving performance. If you do not pass a `CachedHash` to `stable_hash` it
sets up its own internal cache to improve performance for repeated hashes of the same type
or large values seen *within* the call to `stable_hash`.

For an object to be cached you must either signal that it should be, using
[`UseCache`](@ref) or it must be:

- large enough: this is to ensure that calls to retrieve a cached result do not exceed the
  time it takes to simply re-hash the individual bytes of an object. You can refer to the
  constant `CACHE_OBJECT_THRESHOLD` though it is not considered part of the public API and
  may change with future hash versions. (The threshold will not change for a given hash
  version, since changing it can change an object's hashed value).
- mutable: immutable objects cannot be stored in a WeakKeyIdDict, since they aren't
  supported. This means that caching immutable objects can lead to memory leaks if you don't
  clean up the cache regularly, since they are stored in an IdDict. Note that in practice
  large amounts of data are usually stored in mutable structures like `Array` and `String`.

Signal that the hash of `x` should be stored in the cache.

!!! warning "Immutable objects can leak memory"
    If `x` is immutable, caching it will cause the object `x` to be held in memory until the
    cache is garbage collected. `WeakKeyIdDicts` do not support immutable objects. If there is
    no user defined cache, the cache will be garbage collected inside the call to
    [`stable_hash`](@ref). With a user defined hash you will need to make sure your cache
    goes out of scope in a timely fashion to avoid memory leaks.
