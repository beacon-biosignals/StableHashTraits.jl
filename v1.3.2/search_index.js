As long as the context remains the same, this hash is intended to remain unchanged across julia versions. The built-in context is HashVersion{N}, and if you specify a version, this is equivalent to explicitly passing HashVersion{version}. To customize how the hash is copmuted see Using Contexts.\n\nIt is best to pass an explicit version, since HashVersion{4} is the only non-deprecated version; it is much faster than 1 and more stable than 2. Furthermore, a new hash version is provided in a future release, the hash you get by passing an explicit HashVersion{N} should not change. (Note that the number in HashVersion does not necessarily match the package version of StableHashTraits).\n\nIn hash version 4, you customize how hashes are computed using transformer, and in versions 1-4 using hash_method.\n\nTo change the hash algorithm used, pass a different function to alg. It accepts any sha related function from SHA or any function of the form hash(x::AbstractArray{UInt8}, [old_hash]).\n\nThe context value gets passed as the second argument to hash_method and transformer, and as the third argument to StableHashTraits.write.

How precisely this occurs is determined by  the two arguments:\npair Defines how fields are extracted; the default is fieldnames ∘ typeof => getfield but this could be changed to e.g. propertynames => getproperty or Tables.columnnames => Tables.getcolumn. The first element of the pair is a function used to compute a list of keys and the second element is a two argument function used to extract the keys from the object.\norder can be :ByOrder (the default)—which sorts by the order returned by pair[1]—or :ByName—which sorts by lexigraphical order.\nFnHash(fn, [method]): hash the result of applying fn to the given object. Optionally, use method to hash the result of fn, otherwise calls hash_method on the result to determine how to hash it. There are two built-in functions commonly used with FnHash.\nstable_typename_id: Get the qualified name of an object's type, e.g. Base.String and return 64 bit hash of this string\nstable_type_id: Get the qualified name and type parameters of a type, e.g.  Base.Vector{Int}, and return a 64 bit hash of this string.\n@ConstantHash(x): at compile time, hash the literal (constant) string or number using  sha256 and include the first 64 bits as a constant number that is recursively hashed  using the WriteHash method.\nTuple: apply multiple methods to hash the object, and then recursively hash their  results. For example: (@ConstantHash(\"header\"), StructHash()) would compute a hash for  both the string \"header\" and the fields of the object, and then recursively hash these  two hashes.\n\nYour hash will be stable if the output for the given method remains the same: e.g. if write is the same for an object that uses WriteHash, its hash will be the same; if the fields are the same for StructHash, the hash will be the same; etc...\n\nMissing from the above list is one final, advanced, trait: HashAndContext which can be used to change the context within the scope of a given object.\n\nCustomizing hash computations with contexts\n\nYou can customize how hashes are computed within a given scope using a context object. This is also a very useful way to avoid type piracy. The context can be any object you'd like and is passed as the second argument to stable_hash. By default it is equal to HashVersion{1}() and this determines how objects are hashed when a more specific method is not defined.\n\nThis context is then passed to both hash_method and StableHashTraits.write (the latter is the method called for WriteHash, and falls back to Base.write). Because of the way the root contexts (HashVersion{1} and HashVersion{2}) are defined, you normally don't have to include this context as an argument when you define a method of hash_context or write because there are appropriate fallback methods.\n\nWhen you define a hash context it should normally accept a parent context that serves as a fallback, and return it in an implementation of the method StableHashTraits.parent_context.\n\nAs an example, here is how we could write a context that treats all named tuples with the same keys and values as equivalent.\n\nstruct NamedTuplesEq{T}\n    parent::T\nend\nStableHashTraits.parent_context(x::NamedTuplesEq) = x.parent\nfunction StableHashTraits.hash_method(::NamedTuple, ::NamedTuplesEq)\n    return FnHash(stable_typename_id), StructHash(:ByName)\nend\ncontext = NamedTuplesEq(HashVersion{2}())\nstable_hash((; a=1:2, b=1:2), context) == stable_hash((; b=1:2, a=1:2), context) # true\n\nIf we instead defined parent_context to return nothing, our context would need to implement a hash_method that covered the types AbstractRange, Int64, Symbol and Pair for the call to stable_hash above to succeed.\n\nCustomizing hashes within an object\n\nContexts can be customized not only when you call stable_hash but also when you hash the contents of a particular object.

UInt32(0) would be considered safe, since both Int32 and UInt32 have the same type for purposes of hashing (NumberType), but if the user were to write a custom transform_type in a HashExactNumberType context, now this function is no longer safe to use with hoist_type=true.","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Manual","title":"Manual","text":"These examples hopefully help to clarify when type-unstable functions can lead to unexpected hash collisions with hoist_type=true.
