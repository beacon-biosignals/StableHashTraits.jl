It can be tempting to do e.g. (mymetadata(x), x) as a return value for transformer's function. Instead you can use StableHashTraits.TransformIdentity to make sure this won't lead to an infinite regress: e.g. (mymetadata(x), TransformIdentity(x)). Using StableHashTraits.TransformIdentity will cause x's transformed result to be x itself, thereby avoiding the infinite regress.\n\ntransformer customizes how the content of your object is hashed. The hash of the type is customized separately using StableHashTraits.transform_type.","category":"section"},{"location":"#Using-Contexts","page":"Manual","title":"Using Contexts","text":"Because not every package knows about either StableHashTraits or StructTypes, there may be types you don't own that you want to customize the hash of. In this scenario you should define a context object that you pass as the second argument to stable_hash and define a method of transformer that dispatches on this context object as its second argument.\n\nA context is simply an arbitrary object that defines a method for StableHashTraits.parent_context. By default the context to stable_hash is HashVersion{version}(). Because of parent_context, contexts can be stacked, and a HashVersion should be at the bottom of the stack. There are fallback methods for transformer that look at the value implemented by the parent context. In this way you need only define methods for the types you want to customize.\n\nFor example, this customization makes the ordering of named tuple keys affect the hash value.\n\njulia> begin\n        struct NamedTuplesOrdered{T}\n            parent::T\n        end\n        StableHashTraits.parent_context(x::NamedTuplesOrdered) = x.parent\n        function transformer(::Type{<:NamedTuple}, ::NamedTuplesOrdered)\n            Transformer(identity, StructTypes.OrderedStruct())\n        end\n        context = NamedTuplesOrdered(HashVersion{4}())\n       end;\n\njulia> stable_hash((; a=1:2, b=1:2), context) != stable_hash((; b=1:2, a=1:2), context)\ntrue\n\nWithout this context, the keys are first sorted because StructType(NamedTuple) isa StructType.UnorderedStruct.\n\nAs a short hand you can use StableHashTraits.@context for creating simple contexts, like the one above. Like so:\n\njulia> begin\n        @context NamedTuplesOrdered\n        function transformer(::Type{<:NamedTuple}, ::NamedTuplesOrdered)\n            Transformer(identity, StructTypes.OrderedStruct())\n        end\n        context = NamedTuplesOrdered(HashVersion{4}())\n       end;\n\njulia> stable_hash((; a=1:2, b=1:2), context) != stable_hash((; b=1:2, a=1:2), context)\ntrue\n\nThere are several useful, predefined contexts available in StableHashTraits that can be used to change how hashing works:\n\nWithTypeNames\nTablesEq","category":"section"},{"location":"#Optimizing-Custom-Transformers","page":"Manual","title":"Optimizing Custom Transformers","text":"By default, stable hash traits follows a safe, but slower code path for arbitrary functions passed to Transformer. However, in some cases it can use a faster code path, given that some assumptions about the types returned by the transforming function are maintained. The identity function and the functions returned by pick_fields and omit_fields use this faster code path by default.\n\nIn particular, a keyword argument to Transformer, hoist_type can be set to true to use this faster code path. Functions that implement StableHashTraits.hoist_type(::typeof(fn)) can return true to signal that they are safe when using this faster code path. This function is called to determine the default value of hoist_type when this function is passed as the first argument to Transformer.\n\nThe exact criteria for when this code path is unsafe are somewhat subtle, and will be described below, along with some examples. However, you can always safely use hoist_type=true either when the function always returns the same type (e.g. it transforms all inputs into String values) OR when the following three criteria are met:\n\nThe type that transformer dispatches on is concrete.\nThe type that transformer dispatches on contains no abstract types: that is, for any contained array type or dict types, their eltypes are concrete and for any contained data type, its fieldtypes are concrete.\nThe function you pass to Transformer is type stable\n\nWhen set to true, hoist_type=true hashes the type of the pre-transformed object, prior to looping over the contents of the post-transformed object: its fields (for a data type) or the elements (for an array or dict type). Once the contents of the object are being looped over, hashing the type of each concrete-typed element or field is skipped. For example, when hashing an Array{Int} the Int will only be hashed once, not once for every element.\n\nWhen hoist_type=false (the default for most functions) the type of the return value from transformer is hashed alongside the transformed value. This can be a lot slower, but ensures the that no unexpected hash collisions will occur.\n\nMore precisely, this hoisting is only valid when one of these two criteria are satisfied:\n\nthe pre-transformed type is sufficient to disambiguate the hash of the downstream object values absent their object types.\nthe post-transformed types do not change unless the caller inferred type of the input it depends on changes\n\nThe latter criteria is more stringent than type stability. A function input could have a caller-inferred type of Any, be type stable, and return either Char or an Int depending on the value of its input. Such a function would violate this second criteria.","category":"section"},{"location":"#Examples-2","page":"Manual","title":"Examples","text":"When is the pre-transformed type sufficient to disambiguate hashed values? First, many type-unstable functions should be considered unable to meet this criteria. The only time they are certain to be safe is when the values disambiguate the hash regardless of the type.\n\nFor instance, the assmuptions of hoist_type=true would be violated by the function x -> x < 0 : Char(0) ? Int32(0) because the bits that are hashed downstream are identical, even though the type information that should be hashed with them are different: Char is a StringType and Ing32 is a NumberType.\n\nIn contrast, x -> x < 0 : Char(1) : Int32(2) is safe to use with hoist_type=true, because although the type changes, the byte sequence of the value never overlaps, regardless of the type returned. If you are confident the bit sequence will be unique in this way, you could safely use hoist_type=true even though the transformer is type unstable.\n\nBeware! When a type unstable function will be unsafe for a given type depends on the context, because users can define their own type_transform that can lead to more type details being important to the hashed value. For instance, in the default context x -> x < 0 : Int32(0) ? UInt32(0) would be considered safe, since both Int32 and UInt32 have the same type for purposes of hashing (NumberType), but if the user were to write a custom transform_type in a HashExactNumberType context, now this function is no longer safe to use with hoist_type=true.\n\nThese examples hopefully help to clarify when type-unstable functions can lead to unexpected hash collisions with hoist_type=true. However type stable functions can also lead to invalid hashes with hoist_type=true. For example:\n\nstruct MyType\n    a::Any\nend\n# ignore `metadata`, `data` will be hashed using fallbacks for `AbstractArray` type\n# DO NOT DO IT THIS WAY; YOUR CODE WILL BE BUGGY!!!\nStableHashTraits.transformer(::Type{<:MyType}) = Transformer(x -> (;x.a); hoist_type=true)\nstable_hash(MyType(missing)) == stable_hash(MyType(nothing)) ## OOPS, we wanted these to be different but this returns `true`\n\nSetting the flag to hoist_type=true here causes the type of the missing and nothing to be hoisted, since the field a is a concrete type in the return value of Transformer's function. Since only the type of these two values is hashed, their hashes now collide. If the field of the pre-transformed type a was concrete, there wouldn't be any problem, because its type would be hashed, and that would include either the Missing or Nothing in the type hash.\n\nFor this reason, it is better to use pick_fields and omit_fields to select or remove fields from a type you want to transform.\n\nstruct MyType\n    a::Any\nend\nStableHashTraits.transformer(::Type{<:MyType}) = Transformer(x -> (;x.a); hoist_type=false)\nstable_hash(MyType(missing)) != stable_hash(MyType(nothing)) # true\n\n# NOTE: pick_fields sets `hoist_type=true` by default; it is set here explicitly to\n# clearly illustrate\n# what is happening.\nStableHashTraits.transformer(::Type{<:MyType}) = Transformer(pick_fields(:a); hoist_type=true)\nstable_hash(MyType(missing)) != stable_hash(MyType(nothing)) # this is also `true` and is faster than the previous implementation\n\nBottom line: It is not sufficient for the function to be type stable to safely set hoist_type=true. If the return value of your transformer function over its known domain returns multiple distinct concrete types, you can run into problems.","category":"section"},{"location":"#Customizing-Type-Hashes","page":"Manual","title":"Customizing Type Hashes","text":"Types are hashed by hashing the return value of StableHashTraits.transform_type when hashing an object's type and the return value of StableHashTraits.transform_type_value when hashing a type as a value (e.g. stable_hash(Int)).
