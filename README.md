The aim of StableHashTraits is to make it easy to compute a stable hash of any Julia value
with minimal boilerplate using trait-based dispatch; here, "stable" means the value will not
change across Julia versions (or between Julia sessions). 

For example:

```julia
using StableHashTraits
using Dates

struct MyType
   data::Vector{UInt8}
   metadata::Dict{Symbol, Any}
end
# ignore `metadata`, `data` will be hashed using fallbacks for `AbstractArray` type
StableHashTraits.stable_hash(::MyType) = FnHash(x -> x.data) 
a = MyType(read("myfile.txt"), Dict{Symbol, Any}(:read => Dates.now()))
b = MyType(read("myfile.txt"), Dict{Symbol, Any}(:read => Dates.now()))
stable_hash(a) == stable_hash(b) # true
```

## Why use `stable_hash` instead of `Base.hash`?

This package can be useful any time one of the following holds:

- you want to ensure the hash value will not change when you update Julia or start a new session
- you want to compute a hash for an object that does not have `hash` defined
- you want to customize how the hash works, within a specific scope

This is useful for content-addressed caching, in which e.g. some function of a value is stored at a location determined by a hash. Given the value, one can recompute the hash to determine where to look to see if the function evaluation on that value has already been cached.

## Details

You compute hashes using `stable_hash`. This is called on the object you want to hash, and (optionally) a second argument called the context. The context you use affects how hashing occurs (it defaults to `HashVersion{1}()`), see the final section in the README for more details.

There are sensible defaults for `stable_hash` that aim to ensure that if two values are
different, the input to the hash algorithm will differ. 

You can customize the hash behavior for particular types by implementing the trait
`StableHashTraits.hash_method`. It accepts the object you want to hash and, as an optional
second argument, the context. If you define a method that does not accept a context, it will
be used in all contexts. Any method of `hash_method` should simply return one of the
following values, typically based only on the *type* of its input.

1. `WriteHash()`: writes the object to a binary format using `StableHashTraits.write(io, x)`
    and takes a hash of that. `StableHashTraits.write(io, x)`
    falls back to `Base.write(io, x)` if no specialized methods are defined for x.
2. `IterateHash()`: assumes the object is iterable and finds a hash of all elements
3. `StructHash([pair = (fieldnames ∘ typeof) => getfield], [order])`: hash the structure of
    the object as defined by a sequence of pairs. How precisely this occurs is determined by
    the two arugments: 
      - `pair` Defines how fields are extracted; the default is 
        `fieldnames ∘ typeof => getfield` 
        but this could be changed to e.g. `propertynames => getproperty` or
        `Tables.columnnames => Tables.getcolumn`. The first element of the pair is a
        function used to compute a list of keys and the second element is a two argument
        function used to extract the keys from the object. 
      - `order` can be `:ByOrder` (the default)—which sorts by the order returned by
        `pair[1]`—or `:ByName`—which sorts by lexigraphical order.
4. `FnHash(fn, [method])`: hash the result of applying `fn` to the given object. Optionally,
   use `method` to hash the result of `fn`, otherwise calls `hash_method` on the result to
   determine how to hash it. There are two built-in functions commonly used with
   `FnHash`
    - `qualified_name`: Get the qualified name of an objects type, e.g. `Base.String`
    - `qualified_type`: Get the qualified name and type parameters of a type, e.g.
       `Base.Vector{Int}`. 
    Favor these functions over e.g. `string ∘ typeof` as they have been tested to provide
    more stable values across julia verisons and sessions than the naive
    string-ification of types.
5. `ConstantHash(value, [method])`: hash the constant `value`. Optionally, use `method` to
    hash the `value`, otherwise call `hash_method` on `value` to determine how to hash it.
6. `Tuple`: apply multiple methods to hash the object, and then recursively hash their
    results. For example: (ConstantHash("header"), StructHash()) would compute a hash for
    both the string `"header"` and the fields of the object, and the recursively hash
    these two hashes.

Your hash will be stable if the output for the given method remains the same: e.g. if
`write` is the same for an object that uses `WriteHash`, its hash will be the same; if the
fields are the same for `StructHash`, the hash will be the same; etc...

## Breaking changes

### In 1.0:

This is a very breaking release, almost all values hash differently and the API has changed.
However, far fewer manual defintions of `hash_method` become necessary. The fallback for
`Any` should handle many more cases. 

- **Breaking**: `transform` has been removed, its features are covered by `FnHash` and
  `HashAndContext`.
- **Breaking**: `stable_hash` no longer accepts mutliple objects to hash (wrap them in a
  tuple instead); it now accepts a single object to hash, and the second positional argument
  is the context (see below for details on contexts). 
- **Breaking**: The default `alg` for `stable_hash` is `sha256`; to use the old default
  (crc32c) you can pass `alg=(x,s=UInt32(0)) -> crc32c(copy(x),s)`.
- **Deprecation**: The traits to return from `hash_method` have changed quite a bit. You
  will need to replace the old names as follows to avoid deprecation warnings during your
  tests:
    - Favor `StructHash()` (which uses `fieldnames` instead of `propertynames`) 
      to `UseProperties()`.
    - *BUT* to reproduce `UseProperties()`, call `StructHash(propertynames => getproperty)`
    - Replace `UseQualifiedName()` with `FnHash(qualified_name, HashWrite())`
    - Replace `UseSize(method)` with `(FnHash(size), method)`
    - Replace `UseTable` with `FnHash(Tables.columns, StructHash(Tables.columnnames => Tables.getcolumn))`
- **Deprecation**: The fallback methods for hashing are defined within a specific
  context (`HashContext{1}`). Any contexts you make should define a `parent_context`
  method that returns e.g. `HashContext{1}` so that the fallback implementation for any
  methods of `hash_method` you don't implement work properly. (A default version of
  `parent_context` raises a deprecation warning and returns `HashContext{1}`). Refer to the
  discussion below about contexts.

### In 0.3:

To prevent reshaped arrays from having the same hash (`stable_hash([1 2; 3 4]) ==
stable_hash(vec([1 2; 3 4]))`) the hashes for all arrays with more than 1 dimension have
changed.

### In 0.2:

To support hasing of all tables (`Tables.istable(x) == true`), hashes have changed for such
objects when:
   1. calling `stable_hash(x)` did not previously error
   1. `x` is not a `DataFrame` (these previosuly errored)
   2. `x` is not a `NamedTuple` of tables columns (these have the same hash as before)
   3. `x` is not an `AbstractArray` of `NamedTuple` rows (these have the same hash as before)
   4. `x` can be succefully written to an IO buffer via `Base.write` or
     `StableHashTraits.write` (otherwise it previosuly errored)
   5. `x` has no specialized `stable_hash` method defined for it (otherwise
   the hash will be the same)

Any such table now uses the method `UseTable`, rather than `UseWrite`, and so would have the
same hash as a `DataFrame` or `NamedTuple` with the same column contents instead of its
previous hash value. For example if you had a custom table type `MyCustomTable` for which
you only defined a `StableHashTraits.write` method and no `hash_method`, its hash will be
changed unless you now define `hash_method(::MyCustomTable) = UseWrite()`.

## Customizing hash computations with contexts

You can customize how hashes are computed within a given scope using a context object. This
is also a very useful way to avoid type piracy. The context can be any object you'd like and
is passed as the second argument to `stable_hash`. By default it is equal to
`HashVersion{1}()` and this determines how objects are hashed when a more method specific is not defined.

This context is then passed to both `hash_method` and `StableHashTraits.write` (the latter
is the method called for `WriteHash`, and falls back to `Base.write`). Because of the way
the default context (`HashVersion{1}`) is defined, you normally don't have to include this
context as an argument when you define a method of `hash_context` or `write` because there
are appropriate fallback methods.

When you define a hash context it should normally accept a parent context that serves as a
fallback, and return it in an implementation of the method
`StableHashTratis.parent_context`. For example, here is how we could write a context that
treats all named tuples with the same keys as equivalent. 

```julia
struct NamedTuplesEq{T}
    parent::T
end
StableHashTraits.parent_context(x::NamedTuplesEq) = x.parent
function StableHashTraits.hash_method(::NamedTuple, ::NamedTuplesEq) 
    return FnHash(qualified_name), UseStruct(:ByName)
end
c = NamedTuplesEq(HashVersion{1}())
stable_hash((; a=1:2, b=1:2), c) == stable_hash((; b=1:2, a=1:2), c) # true
```

If we instead defined `parent_context` to return `nothing`, our context would need to
implement a `hash_method` that covered the types `AbstractRange`, `Int64`, `Symbol` and
`Pair` for the call to `stable_hash` above to succeed. 

### Customizing hashes within an object

Contexts can be customized not only when you call `stable_hash` but also when you hash the
contents of a particular object. This lets you change how hashing occurs within the object.
See the docstring of `HashAndContext` for details.
